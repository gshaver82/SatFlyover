//When I use the website, I can search for satellite passing by my location
//When I want to search for satellite, I can choose by my current location or 
I can choose a city
//If I choose to search by my location, it will display city name and latitude and 
longitude when I click the Current Location button, and parse that info into the search field, then I can choose category
//When I search by city name, I can filter sattelite by their categories
//When I click the Submit button
//Then it will show us city name, latitude and longitude information of that city
//Then it will display a list of satellites flying over me
//Then it will save search history
//Then it will display satellite picture by category (Back log function)
//When I click on a satellite name from the generated list
//Then it will display info of each satellite, including Satellite name, universal ID, Viewing Conditions, Direction to look, and elevation to search for.
//When I do a search, it will save my search history into local storage so that whenever I open the same webpage, my search history is already there.
//When the history is saved, it will filter out duplicate cities, so it will only show one of each city name
//When I click on a city name from the search history, it will redo that search.
